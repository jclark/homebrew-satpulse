# Working on this tap

This is a Homebrew tap (`jclark/satpulse`, repo `homebrew-satpulse`) packaging
the macOS build of [satpulse](https://github.com/jclark/satpulse). Two formulae,
both built from source.

## Layout

- `Formula/satpulse.rb` — rolling ">= release" channel. **Head-only** (a `head`
  line, no `stable` block) until satpulse v0.3 ships.
- `Formula/satpulse-pre.rb` — rolling ">= prerelease" channel. A normal `stable`
  formula pinned to a `revision` on satpulse `master`, with an explicit
  `version "0.3-pre-YYYYMMDD"`. Re-pointing it is a two-line edit (revision +
  version).
- `lib/satpulse_formula.rb` — the **shared body**. Both formulae
  `include SatpulseFormula`; it contributes the dependencies, `install`,
  `service`, `caveats`, and `test`. **Change shared behaviour here, not in the
  two formula files**, which only declare their own `desc`, `homepage`, and
  download spec. (`homepage` must stay in each formula file — brew's Homepage
  audit is AST-based and can't see it inside the module.)
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — CI.

## The satpulse source repo

The formulae fetch satpulse from `https://github.com/jclark/satpulse.git` at
build time (`head` clones `master`; `satpulse-pre` clones its pinned `revision`).
**Do not assume a local checkout of the satpulse repo exists, and do not
hard-code a path to it.** If you need to read satpulse sources, find an existing
checkout or clone the repo into a temp dir.

`def install` depends on these satpulse files, so changes there can require
formula updates:
- `unix-build.sh` — builds the Go binaries (derives version from git; needs a
  real clone with `.git`, which the git download strategy provides).
- `macos/Makefile` / `macos/find-serial.c` — the `find-serial` C tool.
- `docs/man/*.md` — rendered to man pages with pandoc (`unix-build.sh` does NOT
  generate man pages; only the Makefile does, so the formula runs pandoc itself).
- `configs/satpulse.toml` — installed as the default config, with edits applied
  at install time (schema path, `log.dir` under the prefix, and a rewrite of the
  systemd-specific comment above `#device`).
- `configs/gpsmsg` and `configs/config-schema.json` — installed under
  `share/satpulse` (use `share/"satpulse"`, NOT `pkgshare`, which would be
  `share/satpulse-pre` for that formula).

## Updating the pinned revisions

There are **no `sha256` checksums** to maintain — the formulae use Homebrew's git
download strategy, so the commit `revision` IS the integrity check.

- `Formula/satpulse.rb` is **head-only**: it follows `master`'s tip
  automatically, so "match head" needs no edit. (When v0.3 ships, add a `stable`
  block — `url "...git", tag: "v0.3", revision: "<sha>"` — keeping the `head`
  line.)
- `Formula/satpulse-pre.rb` pins one commit. To re-point it, get the target
  commit and its UTC date:

      # latest master tip ("match head")
      gh api repos/jclark/satpulse/commits/master --jq '.sha, .commit.committer.date'
      # a specific commit ("match a particular prerelease")
      gh api repos/jclark/satpulse/commits/<sha-or-ref> --jq '.sha, .commit.committer.date'

  then edit two lines in the formula:

      revision: "<full 40-char sha>"
      version  "0.3-pre-<YYYYMMDD>"      # the commit's UTC date, no dashes

  `version` must increase monotonically for `brew upgrade` to fire. The date is
  normally enough; if you re-point twice in one UTC day, append a disambiguator
  (e.g. `0.3-pre-YYYYMMDD.2`). Validate as in "Local testing", then confirm with
  `satpulsetool --version`, which stamps the version and the short sha.

## Pinned Go version

The build pins `depends_on "go@1.25" => :build` to match satpulse's tested Go
(`go.mod: go 1.25.0`; its CI uses `go-version 1.25.x`). Plain `go` tracks the
newest Homebrew Go, which the project does not test. `go@1.26` can't be used: it
is only an alias for `go`, and `brew audit` rejects depending on an alias. Bump
this only when satpulse moves to a Go line that has a real `go@N.NN` formula.

## Local testing — and the HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE gotcha

`brew tap jclark/satpulse "$PWD"` makes a **git clone** of this repo at
`$(brew --prefix)/Library/Taps/jclark/homebrew-satpulse`. The clone reflects the
last **commit**, not your working tree — so after committing you must re-tap to
refresh it.

**Always export `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` while developing here.** Before each
`install`/`tap`, Homebrew normally auto-runs `brew update`, which does a
`git fetch` + merge on every tap **including this local clone**. If your local
history has diverged from the clone (which happens after rebases/force-pushes,
but also routinely), that merge can leave **conflict markers in the tapped
clone** — which then break `brew style`/`brew install` with Ruby syntax errors
that are NOT present in your actual files. Disabling auto-update avoids this (and
is faster).

Reliable loop:

    export HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1
    # edit files, commit
    brew untap jclark/satpulse 2>/dev/null; brew tap jclark/satpulse "$PWD"
    brew style jclark/satpulse
    brew install --HEAD --build-from-source jclark/satpulse/satpulse   # or satpulse-pre

Notes:
- `brew style` lints only Ruby. **actionlint** (which lints
  `.github/workflows/*.yml`, e.g. shellcheck SC2046 on `run:` scripts) runs only
  under `brew test-bot --only-tap-syntax`, like CI — run that to catch workflow
  issues locally.
- `satpulsed` installs into `sbin` (often not on PATH); invoke it as
  `"$(brew --prefix)/sbin/satpulsed"`.
- `brew uninstall` / upgrade never overwrites `etc/satpulse.toml`; remove it
  manually if you need a fresh default.
- When done, untap and uninstall so the machine isn't left on the local-path
  tap: `brew untap jclark/satpulse; brew uninstall satpulse satpulse-pre`.

## Restore the machine to a clean (pre-tap) state

After local testing, remove everything so the real GitHub tap can be tested from
scratch:

    export HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1
    brew services stop satpulse 2>/dev/null
    # uninstall each separately: uninstalling a NOT-installed formula from an
    # untrusted local-path tap errors and would abort a combined command
    brew uninstall --force satpulse     2>/dev/null
    brew uninstall --force satpulse-pre 2>/dev/null
    rm -f  "$(brew --prefix)/etc/satpulse.toml"     # brew leaves config behind
    rm -rf "$(brew --prefix)/var/log/satpulse"
    brew untap jclark/satpulse          2>/dev/null
    # brew untap does NOT clear the trust list (see "Tap trust" below): installing
    # recorded satpulse in $HOMEBREW_USER_CONFIG_HOME/trust.json. That dir is
    # ~/.homebrew by default; confirm with
    #   brew ruby -e 'puts ENV.fetch("HOMEBREW_USER_CONFIG_HOME")'
    # If satpulse is the only thing in the file (the usual case here), just delete
    # it — brew recreates it on demand; otherwise edit out only the satpulse lines:
    rm -f "$(brew ruby -e 'puts ENV.fetch("HOMEBREW_USER_CONFIG_HOME")')/trust.json"

Verify clean: `brew list | grep satpulse` prints nothing,
`$(brew --prefix)/Library/Taps/jclark` is gone, and `trust.json` no longer lists
`satpulse` (or is absent). (`go@1.25`/`pandoc` build deps may remain;
`brew autoremove` drops them, but a fresh install re-fetches them anyway.)

## Tap trust (qualified name = consent)

Homebrew gates non-official taps behind a trust list. The crucial subtlety for
reproducing a first-timer's experience: **`brew install` auto-trusts any formula
you name by its fully-qualified `tap/owner/name`.** `brew install` (and
`reinstall`/`upgrade`) calls `Homebrew::Trust.trust_fully_qualified_items!`,
which writes the formula into `trust.json` and prints `Trusted formula …` —
*before* anything is built. So:

- `brew install jclark/satpulse/satpulse` — the qualified name **is** the
  consent. It never shows the untrusted prompt and re-creates the `trust.json`
  entry every time, so deleting `trust.json` first is futile against this exact
  command. This is what the dev loop above uses (auto-trust is fine there).
- `brew tap jclark/satpulse && brew install satpulse` — a **bare** name fails
  brew's `full_name?` check, is skipped by auto-trust, and instead hits
  `require_trusted_formula!` → `UntrustedTapError` ("If you trust this tap, tap
  it explicitly… `brew trust …`"). **This is the genuine first-timer path** — use
  the bare name to test it.

`brew untap` does not clear `trust.json`; restore it as in the section above.

## CI

`.github/workflows/test.yml` runs on PRs and pushes to `main`:
- `syntax`: `brew test-bot --only-tap-syntax` (style + actionlint + audit).
- `test` (macos-15, Apple Silicon only — the project does not test/ship Intel):
  builds both channels `--build-from-source` and runs hardware-free smoke tests
  (`satpulsetool --version`, `satpulsed --help`, `find-serial --help`).

`setup-homebrew` auto-taps and trusts this repo from the checkout — do NOT add a
manual `brew tap` step (it causes a "Tap remote mismatch" failure).

## Conventions

- **Regular commits only** — no history rewrites, no force-pushes.
- No `Co-Authored-By` trailer (`.claude/settings.json` sets
  `includeCoAuthoredBy: false`).
- macOS-specific end-user documentation belongs in the **satpulse repo**, not
  here.
